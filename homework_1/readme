DATA_ENG 300 Homework 1

This repository contains the first homework assignment for DATA_ENG 300, focusing on data cleaning and exploratory data analysis using Python and pandas.

Overview

The dataset is extracted from `T_F41SCHEDULE_B43.zip'. The goal is to identify and handle missing values in key columns, apply data cleaning techniques, and answer analytical questions.

---

Contents

- `NEW_HW1.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing all analysis, code, and commentary.
- `T_F41SCHEDULE_B43.zip`: The dataset used (not included in this repo for privacy reasons).

---

Setup
1. Install required Python packages:
    pip install pandas numpy re matplotlib seaborn 
2. Ensure the data file `T_F41SCHEDULE_B43.zip` is located in the same directory as the notebook and extract the data.

Key Questions Addressed

Question 1: Investigate Missing Data
- Task:
  - Impute missing values into the dataset
- A cleaned version of the dataset 'inventory_cleaned' is created using `inventory.copy()`.
- Columns analyzed: `CARRIER`, `CARRIER_NAME`, `MANUFACTURE_YEAR`, `NUMBER_OF_SEATS`, `CAPACITY_IN_POUNDS`, and `AIRLINE_ID`.
- Techniques:
  - Null value identification
  - Logical imputation based on patterns (e.g., CARRIER/UNIQUE_CARRIER values for "North American Airlines")


Question 2: Data Cleaning
- Task:
    - Standardize and transform the data
- Columns analyzed: 'MANUFACTURER', 'MODEL', 'AIRCRAFT_STATUS', and 'OPERATING_STATUS'
- Strategies:
  - Dropping irrelevant rows
  - Replacing nulls where possible
  - Type conversion and validation

Question 3: Remove Missing Data
- Task:
  - Remove data rows that still have missing values

Question 4: Transformation and Derivative Variables
- Task:
  - Check skewness for the columns 'NUMBER_OF_SEATS' and 'CAPACITY_IN_POUNDS'
  - Implement Box-Cox transformation to make variables more "normal-like"
- Outputs:
  - Amount of skewness before and after transformation
  - Histogram of the columns before and after transformation

Question 5: Feature Engineering
- Task:
  - Create 'SIZE' column by the quartiles of 'NUMBER_OF_SEATS'
  - Analyze proportion of operating aircrafts and status of aircraft grouped by the size group
- Outputs:
  - Barplot and table of the proportion of operating status by size
  - Barplot and table of the proportion of aircraft status by size
